# Distributed_Data_Analysis_Python
The goal of the project is to gain understanding and value from analysing disparate data sets.  We will put into practise a number of different analytic methods, techniques, and algorithms, assess their performance, and then compare them to one another. Teamwork and regular meetings will aid in the planning and execution of the data analysis.
